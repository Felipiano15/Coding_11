## A1 Notes
### How to compile CPP
Do this `g++ -o filename filename.cpp`

Do this to run `./filename.exe`

### Git instructions

Steps are as follows.

1. Make all the code changes.

2. Always to check your status with `git status`

3. You need to stage the changes with `git add .`

4. You need to make commit (save changes locally) with `git commit -m "add a message here"`

5. When you are ready, you can push changes to the cloud with `git push`

6. If you want to download changes from the cloud, then do `git pull`










## Unit 2 - Gene Expressions @ Protein Synthesis Notes
### Notes
##


DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)


Each human cell has at least 2 metres of DNA packed into the nucleus which is about 5 micrometres in diameter. `Chromatin` (different term(DNA wrapped around `histone proteins`)) condenses into chromosomes only during cell division. (Segments of DNA (genes) code for traits).


The two main macromolecules in chromatin are `Nucleic acid and proteins`.


There are `23 pairs` of chromosomes in most somatic human cells, with `46 in total`.
___
## DNA is.


1. an `ORGANIC` molecule found in the `nucleas`.


2. A polymer made up of `NUCLEOTIDE` monomers


3. Stores genetic information.


4. Replicates and transmits information to offsring.


5. Controls protein synthesis.


6. Is `Double-Stranded` with `Complimentary` BASE PAIRING `(A-T and C-G)`.


7. Forms a `DOUBLE-HELIX` (H bonding between the base pairs)


## Nucleotides (monomers of nucleic acid) are made of 3 PARTS:


1. `Nitrogenous Base`
2. `Phosphate Group`
3. `Deoxyribose (Pentose) Sugar`


## Evidence for DNA's structure:


1. In 1950, Erwin Chargaff discovered that A=T and C=G in DNA, now known as Chargaff’s Rules. This helped Watson and Crick in 1953 confirm DNA’s double helix structure with complementary base pairing.


2. In 1951, Rosalind Franklin captured Photo 51 using X-ray crystallography, revealing DNA’s helical shape. Her work provided key evidence that helped Watson and Crick in 1953 confirm DNA’s double helix structure.


3. In 1962, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of DNA’s double helix structure. Their work, based on Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray diffraction data, revealed how DNA stores and replicates genetic information. Rosaline did not get awarded because she passed away.


## Chargaff's rule table:


| Sample | A (Adenine) | T (Thymine) | G (Guanine) | C (Cytosine) |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
|Sample Q|15|15|35|35|
|Sample Z|25|25|25|25|




# BASE-PAIR RULE:
`A binds with T, G binds to C`


| One Side | ATA | TCA | TGC | GGG |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Other side | TAT | AGT | ACG | CCC|


# Nitrogenous (nitrogen-containing) Bases
Nitrogenous bases come in two categories:


1. `Purines` (double ring)
2. `Pyrimidines` (single ring)


## Nitrogenous bases make two types of bonds:
1. `Covalent` bond to sugar.
2. `Hydrogen` bonds to another nitrogenous base.


`A-T` = 2 H- Bonds
`C-G` = 3 H- Bonds


2 strands of DNA run anti-parallel! 5' to 3' on one side, 3' to 5' on the other side.
